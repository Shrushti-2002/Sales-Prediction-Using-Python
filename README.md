📊 Sales Prediction Using Python

📌 Project Overview

- Sales Prediction is a machine learning project that focuses on forecasting product sales based on advertising expenditure across multiple platforms such as TV, Radio, and Newspaper.

- By analyzing historical advertising data, this project demonstrates how data science and machine learning techniques can help businesses make informed decisions about marketing budgets and maximize sales potential.

🎯 Objective

- Analyze the impact of advertising expenditure on sales

- Build a regression model to predict future sales

- Evaluate model performance using standard metrics

- Visualize relationships between advertising channels and sales

📁 Dataset

📊 Data Visualization

The project includes several visualizations to better understand the data:

- Sales vs TV Advertising

- Sales vs Radio Advertising

- Sales vs Newspaper Advertising

- Correlation Heatmap

- Actual vs Predicted Sales

These visualizations help identify which advertising channels have the strongest influence on sales.

🤖 Machine Learning Model

- Algorithm Used: Linear Regression

- Reason: Simple, interpretable, and effective for linear relationships between advertising spend and sales

📈 Model Evaluation Metrics

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

- R² Score

These metrics measure prediction accuracy and model performance.
